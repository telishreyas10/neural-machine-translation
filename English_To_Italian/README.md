# Neural Machine Translation - English to Italian

The goal of this project is to develop a Neural Machine Translation (NMT) system capable of translating English text into Italian. NMT has shown great promise in achieving high-quality translations by leveraging deep learning techniques and large-scale training data.

The project will involve implementing an encoder-decoder architecture with attention mechanism, which is an effective model for sequence-to-sequence tasks like machine translation. The encoder will process the input English sentence and generate a meaningful representation, while the decoder will generate the corresponding Italian translation based on the encoder's output. The attention mechanism will enable the model to focus on relevant parts of the input during translation.

We have developed Neural Machine Translation (NMT) model using TensorFlow to facilitate the translation of text from English to Italian. This model has been extensively trained on a substantial dataset consisting of over 200,000 sequences, ensuring a robust and consistent performance.

The architecture of the model follows the encoder-decoder paradigm, which is particularly effective for sequence-to-sequence tasks like machine translation. The encoder component encodes the input English sentence into a latent representation, capturing its semantic and contextual information. This representation is then used by the decoder component to generate the corresponding Italian translation.
